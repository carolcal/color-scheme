# Color Scheme 

## Description

This project has been crafted to assist designers and developers to create their project palettes. In this application, users can select a base color, specify the desired color combination type, and indicate the number of colors they'd like the app to generate. Subsequently, the app transmits this information to an open API called "The Color API" and renders its response. Then users can conveniently copy the HEX values of the generated colors with a simple click.
